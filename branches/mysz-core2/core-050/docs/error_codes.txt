All classes have their own error codes. But in all classes is one convention: every type of exception is in its range:

Constant errors:
CEReadOnly        - 10

Other:
CESyntaxError     - between 100 and 199
CETypeError       - between 200 and 299
CEFileSystemError - between 300 and 399
CENotFound        - between 400 and 499
CEDBError         - between 500 and 599
